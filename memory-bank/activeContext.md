# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Work Focus
The chat application is in a functional state with core features implemented. The main focus areas are:

1. **Feature Completion**: All basic chat functionality is working
2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Clean, modern interface has been implemented
3. **Room Validation**: Room existence checking is implemented
4. **Participant Management**: Users can view room participants with a dedicated sidebar
5. **Sidebar Implementation**: Modern, responsive participants sidebar is now fully functional

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Implemented room existence validation endpoint (`/room/:id/exists`)
- ✅ Added participant display functionality (`/getAllParticipants`)
- ✅ Enhanced UI with modern design using Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Improved authentication flow with proper token handling
- ✅ Added room ID copying functionality
- ✅ Implemented responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ **NEW**: Created ParticipantsSidebar component with modern UI
- ✅ **NEW**: Implemented sidebar toggle functionality in ChatComponent
- ✅ **NEW**: Added participant state management to prevent duplicates
- ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced backend with WebSocket disconnection handling
- ✅ **NEW**: Added refresh functionality to participants list

## Next Steps
Based on the README file, the following items are identified for future development:

1. **Security Enhancement**: 
   - Review localStorage usage for user data storage
   - Consider implementing more secure session management
   - Evaluate current authentication approach

2. **Room Validation Improvements**:
   - The room ID validation endpoint is implemented but could be enhanced
   - Consider adding room capacity limits
   - Implement room persistence in database

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Message history persistence
   - File sharing capabilities
   - Typing indicators
   - Message reactions/emojis

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Strategy
- Currently using localStorage for token and user data storage
- JWT tokens are used for session management
- Consider implementing refresh tokens for better security

### WebSocket Implementation
- Using native WebSocket API on frontend
- WebSocket server integrated with Express server
- Room-based message broadcasting is working effectively

### Database Design
- User schema: email, password (hashed), username
- Room schema: roomID, username (for participant tracking)
- Consider adding message persistence for chat history

### Deployment
- Application appears to be deployed on Render (based on WebSocket URL)
- Both frontend and backend are containerized and deployed

## Current Technical Debt
- Some console.log statements remain in production code
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- TypeScript types could be more strictly defined
- Consider implementing proper logging system

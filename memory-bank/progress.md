# Progress: Current Status and Known Issues

## What Works

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **User Authentication System**
   - User registration with email, username, and password

   - Token validation and user session management
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt

2. **Real-time Chat Functionality**
   - WebSocket-based real-time messaging
   - Room-based chat system
   - Message broadcasting to all room participants
   - Username display for each message
   - Message timestamps

3. **Room Management**
   - Automatic room ID generation for new rooms
   - Room existence validation endpoint
   - Join existing rooms by room ID
   - Room ID copying to clipboard
   - Participant display functionality with sidebar
   - Real-time participant list updates

4. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern design with Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Navigation between different pages
   - Professional chat interface with message bubbles
   - Participants sidebar with modern design
   - Responsive sidebar with backdrop overlay

5. **Backend API**
   - RESTful API endpoints for authentication
   - Room management endpoints
   - WebSocket server integration
   - MongoDB database integration
   - CORS configuration
   - Participant management with disconnection handling

## What's Left to Build

### ðŸ”„ Potential Improvements
1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Review localStorage usage for user data
   - Implement refresh token mechanism
   - Add input sanitization and validation
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Message history persistence
   - File sharing capabilities
   - Typing indicators
   - Message reactions/emojis
   - Private messaging
   - Room capacity limits

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Better error messages and notifications
   - Offline message queuing
   - Message search functionality
   - User presence indicators
   - Room creation with custom names

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Logging system implementation
   - Code cleanup (remove console.log statements)
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Unit and integration tests

## Current Status

### ðŸŸ¢ Fully Functional
- User authentication and session management
- Real-time chat messaging
- Room creation and joining
- Participant management with sidebar
- Responsive UI design
- Participants sidebar with refresh functionality

### ðŸŸ¡ Partially Implemented
- Room validation (basic implementation exists)
- Error handling (basic implementation)
- Message persistence (in-memory only)

### ðŸ”´ Not Implemented
- Message history storage
- File sharing
- Advanced security features
- Comprehensive testing

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Console Logging**: Production code contains console.log statements
2. **Error Handling**: Some API endpoints lack comprehensive error handling
3. **TypeScript**: Some type definitions could be more strict
4. **Code Organization**: Some components could be better organized

### Potential Issues
1. **localStorage Security**: User data stored in localStorage may not be the most secure approach
2. **WebSocket Reconnection**: No automatic reconnection logic for dropped connections
3. **Message Ordering**: No guarantee of message delivery order
4. **Room Persistence**: Rooms are not persisted in database, only in memory

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Usage**: All active connections stored in memory array
2. **Scalability**: Current architecture may not scale to many concurrent users
3. **Database Queries**: Some endpoints could be optimized

## Deployment Status
- Application appears to be deployed on Render platform
- WebSocket URL points to production deployment
- Both frontend and backend are containerized
- Environment variables configured for production

## Next Priority Items
1. Implement message history persistence
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Clean up console.log statements
4. Implement proper logging system
5. Add input validation and sanitization
6. Consider implementing refresh token mechanism
